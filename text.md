# number generating logic for scores

## Randomness Within Ranges

- SAT Scores: Randomly generate scores between 1200-1600, divided by sections (e.g., Math: 600-800, Reading/Writing: 600-800). Include humorous notes for edge cases (e.g., "800 Math because I can solve integrals in my sleep, but 620 Reading because I don't read instructions").
- TOEFL Scores: Generate totals between 90-120 and assign subscores that hint at quirks (e.g., "Listening: 29 because I eavesdrop too much").
- AP Exam Scores: Assign scores of 3-5 for most subjects, with at least one 2 or 4 for relatability (e.g., "Physics C: Mechanics: 4—just one unlucky multiple-choice question away from glory").

## Weighted Randomization for GPA

- For U.S.-style GPA (4.0 scale): Generate 3.8-4.0 for "top student vibes" or 3.5-3.7 for "I swear I tried hard."
- For percentage-based GPA: Generate scores in the range of 88%-98%, skewed higher. Add commentary like, "94.5% (but that one chemistry lab brought it down)."
